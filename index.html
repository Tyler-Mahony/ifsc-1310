    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>There were not a lot of issues I got from feedback on this assignment from those I showed the site to, but some of the things that were addressed was the lack of formating/styling in the history and FAQ sites, and the more information going to the basic SpaceX website. To fix this I changed the link to go to SpaceX's dragon wepsite which is off of their main website. The issues with the styling I had issues trying to fix, as I couldn't figure out how to manuever through the already written CSS to affect the history and FAQ sites. However I did add a small change which was adding titles to the sections that I did style very slightly to fit the color scheme I used a little better. The things I think that I did well was trying to implement a little bit of everything. The things I struggled with would be creativity in design, and not utilizing every tool in the bag at my disposal. I did also add a slideshow similar to the cycle lab, with a small change from the demonstration being that it's a click slide show, so each click changes the picture.</p>
    <p>If I had to startover this project entirely, I'd have given myself more time. I would look through similar websites including SpaceX's dragon website and tried to use similar design principles and information to build a better website. I would also redo the CSS and I would format it in a way that would make it easier to read top to bottom to find CSS based on what site you're on. I would also add comments to understand what I did because that would've been useful in the revamping part of the project.</p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>My initial thoughts on progressive enhancement is that it's right. Websites should be built with the core being the content. If the content is bad, or badly formatted, then the website isn't going to be good. I've been on websites that look absolutely beautiful, but had a huge lack of content that made all that styling go to waste. I almost would've preferred something similar to our gordo assignment. I've also been on websites that look horrible but because of the good content, I've found myself using it multiple times for work. Good content gives a website the strong foundation it needs to be good, and with that strong foundation you can start to build a house on that actually makes it all come together. Then finally the final piece being functionality like ovens, microwaves, and all that sorts of stuff. Ultimately I would say progressive enhancement is very important in web development, as in this class alone we started with a strong foundation (gordo) and built up to our final project (dragon).</p>
